## Clone Raspberry Pi OS from SD Card to SSD using rpi-clone

- [Repository](https://github.com/geerlingguy/rpi-clone)

- [Tutorial](https://rpi-clone.jeffgeerling.com/)

1) Installation

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geerlingguy/rpi-clone/master/install | sudo bash
```

If booting off an internal microSD card, clone to a PCIe NVMe SSD, use the following command:
```bash
# Micro SD ---> SSD
sudo rpi-clone nvme0n1
```

For some reason, the Raspberry will be able to boot and mount SSD as root, but you won't be able to SSH into it, even after changing boot order.

With SD Card inside everything works fine.
